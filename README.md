# Game-of-Life
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life by myself.

This program requires NumPy and PyGame to run.
If your versions does not work, the versions I
used to create this program is:
PyGame -> 1.9.4.dev0 (1.9.4 should probably work)
NumPy -> 1.12.1

After the requirements are met you can start the program.

The program starts with an empty window, only grids are shown
on the screen. This is the drawing mode and you can click to
the boxes to draw them. Left click draws and right click erases.
After you finished you can press the enter button, after you
press enter the drawing mode will end and the operating mode will
start, at this mode the Game of Life cellular automata will run
by the initial positions you are given, this is Game of Life.
After you are satisfied you can press enter again to get back
to the drawing mode and so on.

### Edit: 
A P5.js version is also added, working with a similiar logic.
